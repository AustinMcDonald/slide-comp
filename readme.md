to run the code you need to compule the cython code this should be done by running the setup.sh file.

the fiducal are can be seen by running the monos-show

the paramaters for this are used in histmaker.

hist maker has the paths hard coded into it but this runs through the files and histograms the pixels
in the fiducal region set. this produces a .npy file

that file is the histogram and is loaded into monos hist v5 to see them.
